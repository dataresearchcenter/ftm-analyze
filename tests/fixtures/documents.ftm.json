Ares(2021)4583348 - 15/07/2021\n \n \nFoodDrinkEurope views on substantiating green claims and the \nuse of PEF \nIntroduction  \nFoodDrinkEurope members are committed to increasing transparency on the environmental footprint of \nfood and drink products and provide clear and reliable information to consumers. We therefore support the \nEuropean Commission\u2019s intention to propose policy on green claims which aims to establish an EU-\nharmonised legislative framework for the voluntary provision of product environmental footprint \ninformation to consumers.  \nWe would like to provide further thoughts building on our earlier response to the public consultation on the \ngreen claims initiative. We call on the European Commission to take this input into account during the impact \nassessment of the green claims initiative. Our new comments revolve around the following:  \n\u2022 \nThe scope of the new policy framework (incl. the definitions of \u2018environmental footprint\u2019 and \u2018green \nclaims\u2019) \n\u2022 \nSuggestions for the policy framework impact assessment \n\u2022 \nThe simplification of the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) methodology \n\u2022 \nKey principles for the communication of environmental footprint information to consumers  \n\u2022 \nComparability of environmental footprint information \n\u2022 \nThe flexibility for making green claims  \nScope of the new policy framework \nFoodDrinkEurope supports the development of an EU-harmonised legislative framework for the provision of \nvoluntary product environmental footprint information to consumers, so-called green claims initiative, as \nannounced in the new Circular Economy Action Plan.  \nWe believe that this framework will empower consumers to make more environmental sustainable choices \nand create a level playing field for market operators across the EU. It will also contribute to drive the market \ntowards more sustainable products and supporting companies with improving their production chain in a \ncoherent manner. This will encourage the sharing of credible information and prevent misleading claims and \ngreen washing and provide harmonization on the single market on the provision of such information to \nconsumers. \nIn our view, the legislative proposal should be based on the EU-harmonised environmental footprint \nmethodology/ communication which is based on the full Life Cycle Assessment -LCA of products, so called \nthe PEF methodology. \nThe term \u2018Green claims\u2019 is a broad term which covers voluntary LCA-related claims (e.g. environmental \nfootprint based on EU PEF methodology) and voluntary non-LCA related claims (e.g. recyclability of \npackaging, farming practices including animal welfare). It can include:   \nAvenue des Nerviens 9-31 - 1040 Brussels - BELGIUM - Tel. +32 2 514 11 11  \ninfo@fooddrinkeurope.eu - www.fooddrinkeurope.eu - ETI Register 75818824519-45 \nCopyright FoodDrinkEurope aisbl; photocopying or electronic copying is illegal \n\" FOODDRINK\nEUROPE study4). The outcomes of these studies should provide useful insights on what could be an appropriate \nground for comparing food and drink products from an environmental footprint perspective.   \nFlexibility on making claims \nUntil a broader number of PEFCRs are developed, the future EU legislation should allow manufactures to \nsubstantiate their communications using the basic PEF methodology for the food, beverage and pet food \nsector. Comparison under this framework would need to be well argued and scientifically proven. \n \n \n \n4 EUFIC has recently launched the project Bridging the gap between healthy and sustainable diets. This project employs a mixture of qualitative and \nquantitative methodologies to understand how consumers in multiple European countries think about foods/diets that are both healthy and \nenvironmentally sustainable, what kind of information they want to know about such foods/diets, and which communication means/tools/channels \nare most effective in delivering such information to consumers with the purpose of steering towards healthier and more sustainable food choices and \neating patterns. EUFIC is currently in the process of collecting semi-qualitative data on consumer attitudes, needs, and wants in this domain. The \nresults of this research will feed into a follow up experimental study that will examine the effectiveness of various types of communication about \nfood-related healthiness and sustainability as they will emerge from the semi-qualitative data. \n \n4/4 \u2022 \nVoluntary environmental footprint communications substantiated by a full PEF/ LCA study. \nCommunication examples: claims on absolute value, comparison, improvement for one or several \nfootprints (e.g., carbon reductions) /OR environmental footprint scoring schemes (e.g., Eco-score) \nused in business to business or business to consumer communication, and additional sets of \ninformation (biodiversity loss) \n\u2022 \nVoluntary environmental communications on packaging attributes substantiated by recognised \ninternational standards, e.g. ISO 14021-2016. Communication examples: recyclable packaging, \ncompostable materials, etc.  \n\u2022 Other voluntary sustainability communications substantiated by recognised international \nstandards/reports (e.g. IPCC report). Communication examples: positive externalities of food process \n(e.g. biodiversity) or/and on messages encouraging consumers to make lifestyle changes (e.g. reduce \nfood waste in consumption stage) or/and farming practices including animal welfare (e.g. \ninformation on feed composition and traceability will be required to support the claims) \nThe future green claims lesgislation should focus on the first type of claims listed above, i.e. the \nenvironmental footprint (LCA-based)  \nPolicy framework impact assessment \nWe call for the impact assessment to consider:  \n\u2022 \nThe implications and cost-effectiveness of the proposed measures on companies, including SMEs, so \nas not to incur inefficient use of company resources; \n\u2022 \nPromoting innovation to reduce the environmental  footprint of products along their life-cycle;  \n\u2022 \nThe involvement of the private sector in the creation of EU-wide PEF product group and sector-\nspecific rules (PEFCRs), with input from other relevant stakeholders; \n\u2022 \nRunning new pilots for products that are not subject to category rules (with real life setting test with \nconsumers). \nSimplification of PEF \nWhile the use of PEF presents advantages for companies, such as for the identification of hotspots, the \nmethodology is complex, and it requires time for developing PEF Category Rules (PEFCRs). We call for the \nEuropean Commission to accelerate efforts to simplify the PEF, in particular through:  \n\u2022 \nBased on the PEF Guide1, developing specific guidelines/toolkit for the food, beverage and pet food \nsectors, which help identify the environmental impact indicators that are \u201crequired\u201d and \n\u201crecommended\u201d by the policy framework, and provide requirements and examples applicable to \nthese sectors;  \n\u2022 \nThe above guidelines should also provide details on how to make comparison between products \nwhich are not covered by PEFCRs  \n\u2022 \nEnsuring easy access to up-to-date data (especially for SMEs); \n\u2022 \nIncreasing the use of secondary datasets and providing the possibility for companies to cite \nalternative datasets if information related to the environmental impacts of an ingredient is not \navailable as per modular PEFCRs; \n \n1 2013/179/EU: Commission Recommendation of 9 April 2013 on the use of common methods to measure and communicate the life cycle \nenvironmental performance of products and organisations. ANNEX II \u2013 Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) Guide. \n2/4 \u2022 \nImproving the PEF methodologies in a time pace aligned with with product environmental \ninnovations to include further measured environmental criteria. \nDevelop , in collaboration with EU food and beverage sectoral associations, simplified calculation tools which \nallow to calculate the life-cycle environmental  footprint of food and drink products based on the PEF \nmethodology. Such tools should follow basic rules, such as study boundary, emission characterisation factors, \nand weighting of the most relevant environmental impact indicators. Mechanisms for methodological \nupdates should be foreseen to reflect scientific advancements. The review processes for PEF-LCA studies \nshould also be less burdensome, moving from approving the results (control) to checking the process \n(assurance). \nCommunication to consumers \nThe green claims initiative should provide the EU-reference tools by which environmental footprint data (LCA \nbased) can be translated into information that is comprehensible and easy-to-communicate along the supply \nchain, down to the consumers. The legislative framework should therefore prevail over other non-\nharmonised initiatives related to environmental claims \u2013 public or private.  \nVoluntary environmental footprint information can be provided to consumers in different ways. If this \ninformation is provided via a label using a scoring scheme (e.g. A-E scale, colour-coding), based on an PEF-\nLCA assessment, EU regulators should allow manufacturers to display additional information of the most \nrelevant environmental impact indicators2, as foreseen in the PEF Guide. On the other hand, when an \nenvironmental impact indicator, like eg. Carbon Footprint (GHG emissions), is by-far the most relevant \nindicator based on the current PEF definition of \u2018relevant\u20193  (i.e. based on the full PEF assessment), or based \non consumer studies, then regulators should allow manufacturers to make claims on a single environmental \nimpact indicator (e.g. reduction of carbon emissions). In any case, any information to consumers should be \nverifiable, credible, scientifically reliable, transparent, and easy to understand for consumers.  \nThe provision of environmental footprint information to consumers for food and drink products should not \ncome at the expense of other key information, such as nutritional information. In this context, alternative \ninformation channels to product labelling, particularly digital platforms, may be considered.  \nAn ex-post verification system would be the most appropriate system to verify the validity of the claims. Such \nsystems should be based on credible PEF-complaint 3rd-party certification schemes to communicate \nenvironmental footprint information. \nComparability of products \nIn the agri-food sector there is a trend to compare products on the basis of environmental information. Such \ncomparison can be seen would also help improve the environmental footprint of products , if done well and \nin a credible manner. The comparison can be done on the same product over time, between product recipes, \ndifferent products in a shelf,etc. \nIn order to ensure proper and reliable comparison between products, consumer behavior towards \npurchasing food and drink products according to environmental footprint information should be taken into \naccount, in accordance with PEF/LCA methodology. At the moment there is insufficient knowledge and a \nnumber of studies aimed at modeling consumer behavior are ongoing (for example, the ongoing EUFIC \n \n2 EU Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules Guidance, version 6.3, December 2017.
